Hi there! I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at ÉTS Montréal working on computer vision for medical image analysis under the supervision of Prof. Hervé Lombaert and Prof. Christian Desrosiers.

My research adresses the high cost of manually annotating medical images or volumes such as MRI or CT, critical when developing algorithms for medical image segmentation. To reduce the annotation effort required by segmentation algorithms, I have developped active learning methods to identify the most informative samples to annotate and use during training. I have also worked on automating vision foundation models via prompt learning, using only weak labels - much easier to obtain than pixel-wise annotations. Additionally, I am interested in improving the post-treatment of ambiguous predictions through interactive correction.
